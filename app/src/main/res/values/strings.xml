    <string name="AboutNoDiet">It is the hot new weight-loss plan that has got the health world buzzing.
        Today we unveil the diet that lets you have burgers, curries, treats and alcohol, and still lose weight.
        Stick to the super-simple colour-coded plan and you will lose a stone in just six weeks. Sound too good to be true?
        It is not. It is just the simplest diet plan you will ever follow
    </string>
    <string name="AboutFat">Eat fat and lose weight. That is the promise of the Flat Belly Diet.
        Now for the fine print: The kind of fat matters. The plan focuses on monounsaturated fats, which you get from olive oil, nuts, and other plant foods
        During that time, you can not add salt to any food and you must avoid:
        - Processed foods
        - Foods that can make you gassy, like beans, broccoli, and onions
        - Carbs like pasta, bananas, and bagels.
    </string>
    <string name="AboutFast">You will eat three meals and two snacks a day, all purchased from various fast-food
        and chain restaurants or convenience stores. Fried foods are not part of the plan, so you will have to say
        goodbye to the fries. Sodas sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup are also off-limits.
        But you may not miss them. Sinatra offers suggestions for better substitutions for some of your favorites
        and easy tips for cutting fat and calories while still enjoying a diet mainly from fast-food restaurants.
        Alcohol is allowed in moderation. You can enjoy an occasional glass of wine or a cocktail and sip it slowly,
        savoring it, so you don’t want more.
    </string>
    <string name="AboutGrap">The grapefruit diet has outlasted most fad diets. People were even trying it back in the 1930s.
        Its fans claim that grapefruit contains certain enzymes that, when eaten before other foods, help burn off fat.
        The diet, which has several variations, lasts 10-12 days and claims to help you lose as much as 10 pounds.
        Before you head for the citrus aisle, you need to get the facts, especially about the diet’s fat-burning claim.
